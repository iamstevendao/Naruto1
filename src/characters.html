        <h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
        <p>Naruto Uzumaki (Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure. He became the Jinchuriki of the Nine-Tails on the day
          of his birth - a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team
          Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.
          In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by
          the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (Konohagakure
          no Eiyuu, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning
          the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (Nanadaime
          Hokage, Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>

        <h1>Sasuke Uchiha</h1>
        <p>Sasuke Uchiha (Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older
          brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He
          is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki,
          Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire
          the strength needed to have his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance become increasingly demanding, irrational
          and isolates him from others, leading him to become an international criminal. After proving instrumental in ending
          the Fourth Shinobi World War and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicates
          his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants.</p>

        <h1>Sakura Uchiha</h1>
        <p>Sakura Uchiha (Uchiha Sakura, Haruno) is a kunoichi of Konohagakure. When she is assigned to Team 7, Sakura quickly
          finds herself ill-prepared for the duties of a ninja and the complications of her teammates' lives. By training
          under her master, Tsunade, she becomes capable of facing the challenges of the life of a ninja and help those who
          need her..</p>

        <h1>Hinata Uzumaki</h1>
        <p>Hinata Uzumaki (Uzumaki Hinata, Hyuuga) is the former heiress of Konohagakure's Hyuuga clan. Because of her meek
          disposition, her father doubted that she was suited for the responsibilities of leading the clan, much less life
          as a ninja leading him to disinherit her. Nonetheless Hinata persevered and from observation of Naruto Uzumaki
          especially, Hinata found both an example to follow to be more assertive, and a person to love. Through her membership
          with Team 8, she sought to become strong enough to change herself, if even a little at a time.</p>
